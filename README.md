# gist.gallery

## How to add a new gist:

Add a new line to the [index.json](https://github.com/dfm/gist.gallery/edit/master/index.json) file:

```json
{
  "gist_id": "new_gist_id"
}
```

where `new_gist_id` is the ID in the URL for the gist.
For example, the gist ID for the gist `https://gist.github.com/username/1a938ede20bd26ce3dca74637d8b1aee` is `1a938ede20bd26ce3dca74637d8b1aee`.

Then, submit this as a pull request!
